The [Nunataryuk research project](https://nunataryuk.org/) aims to assess permafrost thaw, study how it contributes to climate change, understand its impacts on indigenous communities and other people, and develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. The project brings together world-leading specialists in natural science and socio-economics and connects them with stakeholders from around the Arctic coast. Scientists affiliated with Nunataryuk are publishing papers about their research in peer-reviewed journals.

“Nunataryuk” means “land to sea” in Inuvialuktun, an Inuit language spoken in northwest Canada, referring to areas where land meets the Arctic Ocean. Nunataryuk is an [EU-funded Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/what-horizon-2020#Article) project coordinated by the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de/en.html), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, in Potsdam, Germany.
